# H6 — Spectrum Analyzer

WiFi/BLE spectrum visualization and channel energy detection on ESP32-C6.

## Overview

Real-time RF spectrum analyzer that:
- Scans all 13 WiFi channels for energy levels
- Detects nearby BLE devices and signal strength
- Displays ASCII spectrum visualization via Serial
- Tracks channel utilization over time
- Identifies busiest frequency bands

## Hardware

| Component | Connection | Role |
|-----------|------------|------|
| ESP32-C6 DevKit | Main board | WiFi + BLE dual-mode radio |

## Features

- **WiFi energy detection**: RSSI-based power measurement per channel
- **BLE scanning**: Device discovery with RSSI and name extraction
- **Channel history**: Rolling average over 64 samples
- **ASCII visualization**: Bar graph output for channel energy
- **Busiest channel identification**: Automatic peak detection

## Legal Disclaimer

## IMPORTANT: Read before use.

This project is provided for **educational and authorized security testing purposes only**.

### Authorization Requirements
- You MUST have explicit written permission from the network owner before using this tool
- Unauthorized interception of network communications is illegal under federal and state laws
- This tool should ONLY be used on networks you own or have written authorization to test

### Legal Framework
- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)**: Unauthorized access to computer systems is a federal crime
- **Wiretap Act (18 U.S.C. § 2511)**: Interception of electronic communications without consent is illegal
- **State Laws**: Many states have additional computer crime and wiretapping statutes
- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data collection may be subject to privacy regulations

### Acceptable Use
- Testing security of your own networks
- Authorized penetration testing with written scope
- Academic research in controlled lab environments
- Security education and training

### Prohibited Use
- Intercepting communications on networks you don't own
- Attacking infrastructure without authorization
- Any activity that violates applicable laws or regulations
- Commercial use without proper licensing

### No Warranty
This software is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this software.

### Responsible Disclosure
If you discover vulnerabilities using this tool, follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. Report to the vendor/owner privately
2. Allow reasonable time for remediation
3. Do not exploit beyond proof of concept

## Live Lab Test Plan

Run ONLY on an isolated, authorized own-lab bench against devices, networks,
and spectrum **you own**. No third-party callers, bystanders, or spectrum users
may be within range of any test transmission.

1. **Isolate** - Put the DUT in a shielded/Faraday enclosure or a room with no
   third-party devices in range. Use attenuators on any transmit path.
2. **Own devices only** - Every target (AP, remote, tag, GPS module, drone FC,
   receiver) must be your own hardware.
3. **Lowest power, shortest duration** - Start at minimum TX power / duty cycle
   and use only the seconds needed.
4. **Record** - Save before/after logs to `reports/` (git-ignored). Never
   capture or store third-party traffic.
5. **Cleanup** - Restore placeholder SSIDs (`lab-*`), MACs (`00:11:22:33:44:55`),
   example.com / RFC5737 addresses, and clear any captured data from the device.

> Jammer / spoofer / replay projects are **proofs for study and simulation**
> only. They refuse live interference scenarios: a live bench trigger requires
> the `LAB_*` allowlist environment variable AND explicit `--yes` confirmation,
> and even then only against your own hardware in a shielded bench.
